Pyter documentation
=================================

Pyter is an open-source `Python`__ package for analyzing virological data. It allows for flexible `Bayesian inference`__ of virus titers and virus environmental halflives from raw data on cell infection. Both endpoint titration and plaque assays are supported.

Pyter is designed to be fairly plug-and-play for the scientist who has a relatively standard problem but is a novice coder, but the API also permits a more experienced user to build their own custom models without reinventing the wheel.

Pyter uses `Numpyro`__ to specify models and perform inference from them.
