# About Pyter

Pyter is an open-source [Python](https://www.python.org/) package for analyzing virological data. It allows for flexible [Bayesian inference](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) of virus titers and virus environmental halflives from raw data on cell infection. Both endpoint titration and plaque assays are supported.


Pyter is designed to be fairly plug-and-play for the scientist who has a relatively standard problem but is a novice coder, but the API also permits a more experienced user to build their own custom models without reinventing the wheel.

PyTer uses [Numpyro](https://pyro.ai/numpyro/) to specify models and perform inference from them.
